# smoothEvent
The event booking service of open venues.

SmoothEvent is an open online service for venues to book events for groups, businesses, or even bands. 

Venues such as restaurants, hotels, theatres, coworking spaces; even outdoor spaces such as parks, farms, or backyards can be rented out for private use. 

Planning a large event? Compare venues across a city or across the globe to find the best price and location. 

Hoping to fill your venue? Advertise your space to have optimal visibility to event planners.

Hoping to book a gig, or plan a tour for your show? Plan your tour stops easily in advance, and get paid via the site to guarantee contractual integrity. 

SmoothEvent is your connection between venues and hosts.
